Week 9 Assignment

Add a new page to your portfolio site. Style it using only the Bootstrap theme (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. (don't include a link to your other stylesheet(s) in the head). It should look professional and be functional (don't forget to include jQuery so Bootstrap javascripts work). Push the page up to Github so that it can be viewed live on GH Pages.

The new page can contain any content that you like, but it should be at least 80 lines of HTML long (whitespace lines don't count toward the total). Possible topics include: one of your skills/interests outside of web development, profile of a developer you find inspiring, list of links to web development learning resources, information about a web development topic you find interesting. 

After grading, you can include your custom styles on this page so it matches the theme of the rest of your site, of course.
